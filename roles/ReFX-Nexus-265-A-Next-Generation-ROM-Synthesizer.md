One of the most impressive features of Nexus 2.6.5 is the advanced librarian, which allows you to easily navigate and organize your sounds. You can use three columns for folders, categories, and presets, and see counters for each of them to give you an overview at a glance. You can also use color-coded tags, bookmarks, favorites, and a dedicated location for user presets. And if you want to go back and forth between different sounds, you can use the history function to quickly access your previous selections.
 
Another feature that sets Nexus 2.6.5 apart from other ROM synthesizers is the arpeggiator deluxe, which gives you unprecedented control over your sequences. You can access all sixteen layer arpeggiators, in addition to the main arpeggiator, and edit them individually or together. You can also zoom in and out of the pattern view, and use the follow option to always scroll with the playback. You can extend the pattern length up to 256 steps and play with different modes, rates, lengths, octaves, and swing settings. And you can use the shuffle feature to add some groove and variation to your patterns.
 
Nexus 2.6.5 is not only a powerful synthesizer, but also a versatile effect processor. You can use up to four insert effects per layer, and choose from a wide range of options, such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, distortion, filter, EQ, and more. You can also use two global send effects for each layer, and one master effect for the entire output. And you can tweak each effect with its own dedicated parameters and modulation sources. With Nexus 2.6.5, you can shape your sound in any way you want.
