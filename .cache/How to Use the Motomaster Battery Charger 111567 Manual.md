## Connecting Your Battery
 
Before connecting your battery to the charger, make sure you read and follow the safety instructions in the manual. You should also wear protective eyewear and gloves, and work in a well-ventilated area away from sparks and flames[^1^].
 
To connect your battery to the charger, follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure the charger is unplugged from the power outlet.
2. Identify the positive (+) and negative (-) terminals on your battery and on the charger clamps.
3. If your battery is installed in a vehicle, disconnect the negative (-) cable from the battery first, then disconnect the positive (+) cable. This will prevent sparks and short circuits.
4. Connect the positive (+) clamp of the charger to the positive (+) terminal of the battery.
5. Connect the negative (-) clamp of the charger to a clean, unpainted metal part of the vehicle frame or engine block. Do not connect it directly to the negative (-) terminal of the battery. This will prevent sparks and damage to the battery or vehicle electronics.
6. Plug the charger into a standard 120-volt AC power outlet. The charger will automatically detect the battery type and condition.

## Charging Your Battery
 
Once you have connected your battery to the charger, you can start charging it by following these steps:

1. Select the desired charge rate by pressing the CHARGE RATE button. You can choose between 2A, 10A, or 55A depending on your battery size and charging time. The higher the charge rate, the faster the charging process.
2. Select the desired charge mode by pressing the CHARGE MODE button. You can choose between NORMAL or BOOST mode depending on your battery condition. NORMAL mode is suitable for most batteries that are not deeply discharged or sulfated. BOOST mode is suitable for deeply discharged or sulfated batteries that need a higher initial voltage to start charging.
3. The charger will start charging your battery automatically. The digital display will show the charging status, battery voltage, and fault codes if any. You can also press the DISPLAY button to switch between different information on the screen.
4. The charger will stop charging your battery when it is fully charged or when it detects a fault condition. The digital display will show FULL or a fault code accordingly. You can also press the STOP button to stop charging manually at any time.
5. Unplug the charger from the power outlet before disconnecting it from the battery. Disconnect the negative (-) clamp first, then disconnect the positive (+) clamp. Reconnect your battery cables if your battery is installed in a vehicle.

## Troubleshooting/Fault Codes
 
If you encounter any problems with your charger or your battery, you can refer to the troubleshooting section in the manual or check the fault codes on the digital display. Here are some common fault codes and their meanings:

- E01: Reverse polarity. The clamps are connected to the wrong terminals on the battery. Check and correct the connections.
- E02: 0f148eb4a0
